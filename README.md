# Tic Tac Toe

> This project is about building a tic-tac-toe game for two manual players

This project was divided into four milestones
- __Project setup__ : This took care of the project directories and files organization
- __User Interface__ : This part of the project handled the game UI interactions with the player(s)
displaying relevant instructions and messages based to the game logic outcome.
- __Game logic__ : This section of the project implemented the overall game-logic using OOP in ruby
- __Player Instruction__ : This part of the project provided the readme which contains a complete user guide or player instruction(s) for those who want to play the game.
## Built With

- Ruby


## Live Demo

[Live Demo Link](https://repl.it/@MisoriSimon/tic-tac-toe-ruby#main.rb)

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.



### Prerequisites
- Ruby : you need ruby installed on your local pc

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/Misori-simon/tic-tac-toe.git

### Game Describtion
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

### PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS FOR TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
