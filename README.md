# Tic Tac Toe

> This project is about building a tic-tac-toe game for two manual players

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

This project was divided into four main milestones
- Project setup : This took care of the project directories and files organization
- User Interface : This part of the project handled the game UI interactions with the player(s)
displaying relevant instructions and messages based to the game logic outcome.
- Game logic : This section of the project implemented the overall game-logic using OOP in ruby
- Player Instruction : This part of the project provided the readme which contains a complete user guide or player instruction(s) for those who want to play the game.
## Built With

- Ruby


## Live Demo

### Game Describtion
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3√ó3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
